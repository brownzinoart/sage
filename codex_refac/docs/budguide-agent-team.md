### UI/UX Principles - Zen Design Philosophy
```markdown
1. **Create a Calming Sanctuary**
   - Soft, nature-inspired color palette (sage greens, warm earth tones)
   - Generous whitespace for visual breathing room
   - Organic, rounded shapes (no sharp corners)
   - Subtle, diffused shadows (no harsh contrasts)
   - Smooth, gentle animations that never startle

2. **Reduce Anxiety Through Design**
   - Warm, conversational language ("Take your time", "No pressure")
   - Non-judgmental tone throughout
   - Clear but gentle privacy indicators
   - Avoid clinical or intimidating aesthetics
   - No prominent cannabis imagery that might trigger stigma

3. **Progressive Disclosure with Zen Flow**
   - Start with maximum simplicity: 3 welcoming options
   - Information unfolds naturally, never overwhelming
   - Soft tooltips that appear on hover
   - Expandable cards with smooth transitions
   - "When you're ready..." prompts for next steps

4. **Build Trust Through Calmness**
   - Subtle lab result badges (not aggressive)
   - Privacy status as gentle reminder, not warning
   - Age verification with supportive language
   - Professional yet approachable appearance
   - Consistent, predictable interactions

5. **Conversational Warmth**
   - Breathing dot animation for typing indicators
   - Suggestions appear softly, never demanding
   - Easy message editing without stress
   - "Start fresh" instead of "Clear conversation"
   - Encouraging feedback on every interaction

6. **Accessibility as Kindness**
   - High contrast but with soft colors
   - Generous touch targets for all abilities
   - Respect for motion preferences
   - Clear focus indicators without harshness
   - Screen reader optimized with caring language
```
